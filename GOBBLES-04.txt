PRODUCT
*******

program: Yahoo! Messenger YMSG protocol
website: http://messenger.yahoo.com/

BACKGROUND
**********

GOBBLES was sitting down in lab with Yahoo! Messenger client running
chatting with beautiful Susie who on he friends list on Yahoo. GOBBLES
trying finish read Bruce Schneier _Applied Cryptography_ but Susie keep
buzzing like crazy about music and pets (she say she has nice pussy) and
then suddenly she say she writing some SPARC assembly codes and GOBBLES just
go crazy hehe. Anyway after GOBBLES wake up to see she still talk about
silly gossip, he click 'ignore' button and begin determined to break
Messenger protocol with he new crypto knowledge.

GOBBLES discovered very inane move made by Yahoo engineers in apparent
effort to stop cleartext transmission of password during initial login
packet exchange. Without full disclosure this hole not brought to public
attention and make Yahoo more secure, so how can idiot say that full
disclosure only secure a job?

It wrong saying that only people who defend full disclosure are they who
capitalize on it because not like GOBBLES acquire sports car working at
GOBBLES BUGTRAQ SECURITY INC. When aleph1 leave r00t hacking group to be
security professional he not profit like everyone say, so why everyone have
to give these people hard time if they become security professional and
contribute earth-shattering vulnerability like GOBBLES does in order to
improve security and liberate humanity from darkside malicious cracker out
there in wild?

Revealing symlink vulnerability in Bruce Piano Tuner v0.7 help admin protect
system from cracker out there and make cracker lose root. GOBBLES owes
securityfocus website great deal because they provide helpful information
that help me with cracking incident last year. This cracker he come on one
of my system using team bugtraq penetrator exploit in bad way because
GOBBLES was asleep and couldn't apply patch before cracker gank it from
bugtraq. Anyway, cracker not do any damage, but he thought it his base. With
patch information from securityfocus, GOBBLES was able fix security hole and
lock him out :P

TECHNICAL DETAILS
*****************

GOBBLES look at Dug Song dsniff msgsnarf.c and observe that YMSG application
header have following format:

struct ymsg {
    unsigned char version[8];
    unsigned short length;
    unsigned short type;
    unsigned char unknown1[4];
    unsigned char unknown2[4];
}

GOBBLES look at libyahoo code from sourceforge and observe:

/* Service constants */
#define YAHOO_SERVICE_LOGON             1

GOBBLES doing this on FreeBSD machine so he get patch for like...

FreeBSD-SA-01:48                                           Security Advisory
                                                                FreeBSD,
Inc.

Topic:          tcpdump contains remote buffer overflow

Category:       core
Module:         tcpdump
Announced:      2001-07-17
Credits:        Nick Cleaton <nick@cleaton.net>
Affects:        All releases of FreeBSD 4.x prior to 4.4,
                FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE prior to the correction date
                FreeBSD 3.x is unaffected.
Corrected:      2001-07-09
Vendor status:  Patch released
FreeBSD only:   NO

... this so while he run tcpdump next he won't be compromised by darkside
malicious cracker out there in wild or penetrator typing in wrong host to
Vetescan stealth vulnerability assessment tool.

GOBBLES then run tcpdump and using YMSG structure above as reference he find
first packet with service type constant 0x01. This LOGIN packet. GOBBLES
notice it use MCF/MD5 encryption of user password with crypt(3) salt like
$1$_2S43d5f$. Encrypted password is sent over the wire in LOGIN packet. User
is immediately authenticated. 

MAJOR VULNERABILITY #1 IS THAT ATTACKER MAY SNIFF THIS AND BRUTE FORCE USER
PASSWORD AKIN TO RECENT TEAM BUGTRAQ POP3 'APOP PASSWORDS AT RISK'
ADVISORY:

http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-07/0163.html

MAJOR VULNERABILITY #2 IS THAT ATTACKER WHO CAPTURES LOGIN PACKET CAN USE
SIMPLE REPLAY ATTACK WITH PASSWORD HASH INJECTED IN PACKET SENT BY CUSTOM
CLIENT. 

So only defense afforded by this dumb scheme over sending password
unencrypted is protection against password reuse attack:

"Sociological Ghasche Tree Model And Its 
 Ramifications Concerning Password Reuse 
 On Worldwide Computer Networks - USENIX 1999"  

http://www.sec-lab.cs.qwe.edu/professors/Floyd/whitepapers/1999/reuse.pdf

FIX
***

GOBBLES suggest Yahoo engineer use brain and come up with challenge-response
mechanism. They set bad example for commercial security research community.
They should pull finger out of bum and focus on protecting user instead of
just pulling in money from job. Here $0.2 -- go buy clue.

DEMONSTRATION
*************

As you see above, easy to observe packets with tcpdump. Ethereal not seem to
have YMSG protocol support yet, so SANS professional at sans.org might need
make $50,000/hour other way by using different tool for analysis instead of
ethereal. Come with most operating system is tcpdump or snoop. Can also get
sweet tool ngrep from route[GUARDENT] site:

http://www.packetfactory.net/

Or maybe you be creative and roll your own with Michael Schiffman libnet
socket wrapper. It easy reproduce, no hurry, just take your time and see
what you come up with.
