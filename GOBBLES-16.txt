++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Right now there nasty rumor concerning GOBBLES and GOBBLES Security and
everyone who hang out at GOBBLES Labs, which GOBBLES shall take quick
moment to clear up for all of universe right now so that spread lies die
quick and all slander is done on issue, ok?

When GOBBLES talk about objectional website full of slander and stupidity,
he GOBBLES do not include http:// style url to website for all of world to
see, quite unlike WOBBLES who still insist on making fun of GOBBLES on
lists here and linking GOBBLES to things GOBBLES have no part of.

GOBBLES Security is not associated in any way with antisecurity religious
movement that occuring right now, and all those allegations against
GOBBLES and he group are pure slander.  GOBBLES think it important that
all software bugs are identified and exploits for everythign written and
given out to academic community until penetrations rise so high vendor and
programmer society realize they not exempt from security things and start
to get serious about security so that real security measure can be brought
to Internet and all can live together peacefully without the need of any
penetrators anymore.  For some reason professional programming world think
it still acceptable to put bufferoverflow and formatstring and silly race
condition bug (hehe, Linux kernel!!!!!!!!) in they software and do not
care about people who have much less skill than GOBBLES being able to
break holes in software to get r00t; GOBBLES know that full disclosure
only real way to fix this problem.  

Further on subject to Cousin WOBBLES who now rogue, just because you
WOBBLES work for big dollar company do not make it any more right for you
to be able to make personal attacks on GOBBLES or anyone else on list, and
the fact that you get away with it with silly personally attack on list is
not very right, GOBBLES wish that moderators would be consistant with they
message moderations on personal attacks, and not base them on the color of
skin of list contributer.

WOBBLES, GOBBLES is now personally addressing you in advisory.  Please,
Cousin, do not continue this charade in public forum, if you dislike
GOBBLES, everyone already know this, do not need to continue doing poopy
smear campaign on professional forums.  GOBBLES would appreciate it if you
seperate you professional WOBBLES [bindview] life from WOBBLES [ircs] life
like real professional who not mix work and play, and leave GOBBLES alone
and stop influencing people to ignore all security research done from
anyone but Microsoft Certified Partners like yourself.  GOBBLES think you
being less than professional and is becoming very pissed off at you...

Also GOBBLES wonder about how professional it is of you to be trading you
own code for scriptkid collected code as you imply in email

 http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/vuln-dev/2001-q4/0886.html

and GOBBLES also wonder, why is it really important to post to mailing
lists "another fake exploit" type of messages when everyone know there a
million fake exploits going around (everyone with Redhat Linux Program 
Honeypot should have own copy of WoH.tar.gz by now to prove this), do all
honeypot operators flood mailing lists saying "new fake exploit with my
name on it!" emails?  GOBBLES suspect the only reason you made that post
was so you could put in cruel and slanderous remarks against the little
guys who not making the big dollar from security work who you see as
competition.

Play nice, Cousin WOBBLES -- you very close to being expelled from family 
for good, but if you decide to become nicer we will probably let you stay 
member!

BACKGROUND
**********

GOBBLES do what GOBBLES do best, GOBBLES do he copy/paste!

                  Linux Online - About the Linux Operating System (p1 of 3)

                               What is Linux

   Linux is an operating system that was initially created as a hobby by
   a young student, Linus Torvalds, at the University of Helsinki in
   Finland. Linus had an interest in Minix, a small UNIX system, and
   decided to develop a system that exceeded the Minix standards. He
   began his work in 1991 when he released version 0.02 and worked
   steadily until 1994 when version 1.0 of the Linux Kernel was released.
   The current full-featured version is 2.4 (released January 2001) and
   development continues.

   Linux is developed under the GNU General Public License and its source
   code is freely available to everyone. This however, doesn't mean that
   Linux and its assorted distributions are free -- companies and
   developers may charge money for it as long as the source code remains
   available. Linux may be used for a wide variety of purposes including
   networking, software development, and as an end-user platform. Linux
   is often considered an excellent, low-cost alternative to other more
   expensive operating systems.

   Due to the very nature of Linux's functionality and availability, it
   has become quite popular worldwide and a vast number of software
   programmers have taken Linux's source code and adapted it to meet
   their individual needs. At this time, there are dozens of ongoing
   projects for porting Linux to various hardware configurations and
   purposes.

   Linux has an official mascot, the Linux Penguin, which was selected by
   Linus Torvalds to represent the image he associates with the operating
   system he created.

   Although many variations of the word Linux exist, it is most often
   pronounced with a short " i " and with the first syllable stressed, as
   in LIH-nucks.

Most penetrator familiar with some kind of Linux, normally just Redhat
Linux (GOBBLES know most professional penetrators not whitehat or blackhat
or greyhat really so they must be Redhats, hehe) which is perfect for
penetrators of all perversions.  GOBBLES know that Redhat Linux install
with every possible network daemon running without any default
authentication making it ripe for penetrator pluckings.  GOBBLES realize
this important feature of Redhat Linux (although it seem a little
suspicious after 2,00,000 wuftp exploits that Redhat Linux makers might
make anonymous ftp access not a default feature on they installations, oh
well GOBBLES do not care) useful when customer place machine running
Redhat Linux on network and penetrator can bring laptop to network during
testing with Redhat Linux on it (GOBBLES hope sufficiently secured though,
nothing quite as embarassing as experience from that Blackhat.com
conference speaker guy who talk about how he penetration box got hacked
before during he penetration testing with wuftpd warez, hehe idiot, at
least he learned and now can make big dollar talking about experience at
big conference) to run exploits from and show that yes indeed to customer
that there are exploits from securityfocus.com mailing lists that let
anyone in the world break in to these machines (hehe, penetrator should
advise client to run chrootkit from chkrootkit.org to make sure penetrator
only penetrator on network now hehe).

GOBBLES have remedy for this actually though, where GOBBLES is rewriting
hack.co.za whitehat archive in all Java and making nice interface for it
so that penetrator can just take eEye scanner Retina on audits with
unhackable hardened WinXP then use other exploits written in Java within
pregenerated html pages parsed from Retina scan logs with point/click
security action to penetrate hosts right from reports.  This similar to
farm9.com private penetration suite carried around by farm9.com
penetrators (hehe GOBBLES have funny log of one that will be published
soon on website, stay tuned for this event) during penetration testing
where they do Nessus scan probably then point/click attack servers with
Internet Explorer and java exploits based off hack.co.za exploit, but
since that copyright code GOBBLES cannot publish it and only can publish
he groups own code based on similar compassion for full security community
to benefit from. ;-P



PROBLEM
*******

GOBBLES download recent linux kernel package like:

 ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.16.tar.gz

then GOBBLES issue mv lin* /usr/src command, then chdir there to do he
kernel update.

root@LABSLACK:/usr/src# ls -l
total 30760
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     29652798 Dec 21 20:52 linux-2.4.16.tar.gz
...

Then GOBBLES preceed to do tar zxf linux-2.4.16.tar.gz, normally GOBBLES
would do tar zxvf linux-2.4.16.tar.gz, but then that make advisory really
long hehe, so for today there not any verbosity!!!

!@#!@#!@#@!

Is GOBBLES the only person here who see gaping security problem with this?

TECHNICAL DETAILS
*****************

When doing untar and unzip of tarball for Linux, GOBBLES report that uid and
gid of kernel source not r00t like should be.  "But GOBBLES," say
penetrator, "what is the significance of this?" to which GOBBLES would
say, "hehe, if penetrator understood filesystem permissions and could
program, penetrator would realize hole, here let me explain."

See the two 573 in ls -l?  Those mean files own by user with id of 573,
and group id of 573 also.  So, on system where other user have identical
user id number, GOBBLES know that account can be used to get root on
system because user would be able to _MODIFY_ANY_FILE_ in source, placing
they own trojan and backdoor code, just waiting for idiot administrator to
recompile with they new backdoors...

If you having problem understanding user ids and things like that relating
to filesystem permission system, GOBBLES strongly recommend you read:

 http://www.attrition.org/~bronc/linux2.txt

which is paper by famous hacker Bronc Buster (hackphreak.org, legions.org,
cultdeadcow.com, 2600.com, hacked.cisco.com, very prestigious man) that
indepth covers subject that GOBBLES hisself could not write better. ;)


WORKAROUND
**********

GOBBLES suggest doing:

# chown root.root /usr/src/linux -R

to fix problem until kernel developers decide to put proper patch into
next kernel versions.

System not affected include Solaris, Digital Unix, and FreeBSD; other like
systems have not been checked by GOBBLES yet to see if condition exist in
them too.

Kernels running patches like Openwall and LIDS and grsecurity also are
vulnerable to this attack, so do not get false sense of safety when you do
like patch -p0 stuff that they make you unhackable, hehehe...

DEMONSTRATION
*************

Penetrator X is sniffing traffic to BOX, and get user account login
password to system.  Penetrator X use GOBBLES sftp technique to use login
and password to browse filesystem and steal crucial /etc/passwd file and
also to check to see who own files in /usr/src/linux.

Penetrator X now see it uid 573, so he issue command in sftp like 

sftp>!grep 573 passwd
lucky-idiot:x:573:573:a,very,lucky-idiot,:/home/lucky-idiot:/bin/bash
sftp>

and now Penetrator X know that if he are to get login/password to
lucky-idiot account he be able to get quick root on system when all other
methods of dot and slash failed, so Penetrator X decide to sniff traffic
for a while to see if lucky-idiot will log in.  Also being efficient
penetrator he decide to use ADM tool for pop3 password bruteforce cracking
at same time to see if he can get lucky-idiot password before lucky-idiot
log in (and Penetrator X smart knowing how to use napster.com tool ngrep
to filter out he own IP from sniffer file so lots of lucky-idiot password
attempts from he do not show up in parsed sniffer logs, hehe) and succeed
very quickly in crack when finding lucky-idiot password on he own is same
as username (hehe, translate to user: lucky-idiot password: lucky-idiot),
then penetrator do like:

X@Penetrator:/# ssh -l lucky-idiot victim

to log in, then 

lucky-idiot@victim:/usr/src/linux# cat >>include/something/some.h
# Proof of Concept 
# I could be inserting backdoors in your kernel source right now,
# but I'm ethical whitehat so this is all the demonstration I need
# to do on subject, otherwise you would be 0wn3d right now.
^D

then he log out and write up report for company saying "should be IPSec
network, should not use plaintext protocols, should do chown -R technique
from GOBBLES Advisory (hehe, he good penetrator who let company know where
the real research is done), should be more careful in future, should
submit the big dollar bill you now owe us...."


CONCLUSION
**********

GOBBLES conclude that there are software holes everywhere and in the
silliest things, and sometimes file permissions in things that are not
suid with uid(0) can be exploited in indirect fashions to help penetrator
get root.  GOBBLES suggest using brain a little to realize how this
tar(8) program can introduce so many new holes into system without people
realizing it. 


FUNNY LINKS

1) WOBBLES making fun of commerical software and bragging superiority
   of opensourced software.

2) WOBBLES making fun of Company Bindview.com before WOBBLES got job
   at Bindview; he also make fun of current Bindview employees at the
   time... hmmm WOBBLES, you should have been nicer to them then, it
   probably hurt you salary now!
