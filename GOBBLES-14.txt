Hi Friends, GOBBLES here!  Today GOBBLES would like to take a moment to
say congradulations to Mr. Meritt James (meritt_james@bah.com) for
winning his CISSP certification.  GOBBLES ask you to please send Mr. 
Meritt James a congradulatory email wishing him well with his new 
certification and that he did a good job passing the 250 question multiple
choice test and letting them know he have three years of experience in
professional security industry (probably why he avid bugtraq poster of "i
was able to reproduce error", "i was not able to reproduce error", "take a
look at this paper someone else wrote", "this subject was discussed
indepth on this list two weeks ago, why don't you search archives before
asking questions?", etc).  Anyhow Mr. Meritt James like to write to
mailing lists a lot and let his little signature file on the email to show
the world he have he CISSP and stuff and that he brilliant academic
whitehat security professional for bah.com (hehehe, bah.com company must
be very happy and secure feeling with such a brilliant man on staff
;).  GOBBLES search in depth through mailing list archives and was unable
to discover any research disclosed by him, so GOBBLES suspect that
brilliant academic scientist hacker Meritt James is probably nondisclosure
advocate.  Anyhow GOBBLES say please send meritt_james@bah.com letter
saying, "Hi Merrit_James, I see you can post to mailing lists to let world
know you have CISSP from your signature, good luck and congradulations
friend!"  Maybe someday Mr. Meritt James will change hat color and begin
disclosing brilliant research and own ideas to list someday if we ask him
kindly enough, hehehe!

GOBBLES is now dedicating this advisory to Mr. Meritt James and he CISSP
so that forever the memory of Mr. Meritt James and he CISSP can live on in
bugtraq.org archives.  Good work, friend!  GOBBLES proud of you!

Anyhow make sure you mail friend Mr. Meritt James saying you proud!

***********

                                          Introduction to Webmin (p1 of 2)

                                [intro.gif]
     _________________________________________________________________

                                What is Webmin?

   Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix.
   Using any browser that supports tables and forms (and Java for the
   File Manager module), you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file
   sharing and so on.

   Webmin consists of a simple web server, and a number of CGI programs
   which directly update system files like /etc/inetd.conf and
   /etc/passwd. The web server and all CGI programs are written in Perl
   version 5, and use no non-standard Perl modules.
     _________________________________________________________________

                   What licence is Webmin distributed under?

   Following the acquisition of Webmin by Caldera, all past and future
   versions of Webmin are available under the BSD licence. This means
   that on Linux and other platforms, Webmin may be freely distributed
   and modified for commercial and non-commercial use.

   Because Webmin supports the concept of modules (like PhotoShop
   plugins), anyone can develop and distribute their own Webmin modules
   for any purpose, and distribute them under any licence (such as GPL,
   commercial or shareware). More information about the Webmin API and
   writing your own modules is available.

hehe, webmin very popular product, so it important it be fixed and things
very soon...


SECURITY HISTORY
****************

1. Environment variable problem May 29, 2001
	http://www.caldera.com/support/security/advisories/CSSA-2001-019.1.txt

2. Insecure temp file creation
	http://www.cgisecurity.com/archive/admin/Webmin_0.88_local_root_comprimise.txt

3. Login brute force
	http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/9138

4. Some silly post from some .int guy
        http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-12/0176.html

VERSIONS EFFECTED
*****************

Tested most recent, so others are probably vulnerable, but that can be
exercise for programmer Jamie Cameron (hehe, is that the Titantic guy from
Hollywood a hacker too!?) to decide to find and publish affected
versions.  What does GOBBLES Labs look like, a charity organization?

BACKGROUND
**********

GOBBLES see this post on focus-linux 
	http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/sf/linux/2001-q4/0398.html

and think, heh heh heh, if it advertised it must be popular, and that mean
bugs in it lead to many system being penetrated, hehe.

THE PROBLEM
***********

GOBBLES notice that author of view_man.cgi didn't do input checking and 
commands can be executed using penetrator input. By default the server run 
as root, so all commands executed are as root.  =)

GOBBLES side note to authors: When giving users "shell module" access, the
default should NOT be a root shell, silly fools.  Hehe, you will learn, or
at least GOBBLES hope you will learn!

EXPLOIT DETAILS
***************

GOBBLES say this can be exploited using any browser that support cookies. 
All he have to do is go to url like
	http://photon:10000/man/view_man.cgi?page=ipcs&sec=8&opts=&for=rm 

and s/ipcs/ipcs`advanced penetrator commands`/ and he penetrator has
compromised secure box using GOBBLES technique!  Simple enough even for
commercial penetrators to perform without too much rehearsal at work.
