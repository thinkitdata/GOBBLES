ALERT! ALERT!  CHEROKEE WEBSERVER HAS SEVERE SECURITY HOLES! ALERT! ALERT!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After an email conversation between rfp (rain.forest.puppy) and a GOBBLES
Lab research, we have learned that there has recently been an outbreak in 
fake advisories and trojaned exploits that are being submitted to these
security mailing lists.  The moderators are working very hard to sort out
the legitimate advisories from the immature pranks of many, and they all
deserve words of thanks for their hard work.  This courtesy however should
not extend to the moderators of the so called full-disclosure mailing
lists that delay the release of information to increase the attention to
their commercial services.  GOBBLES Security feels no sympathy for those
moderators while they have to sort through these childish and immature
pranks.  This should not be interpreted as encouragement for said actions
against anyone, but rather as encouragement for the hard workers who have
to put up with the same crap.  Always remember, full disclosure is a
necessary evil, which makes it one of the few sins that God doesn't frown
upon.  Remember, this is the holiday season, and it's important to give...

BACKGROUND
**********

After the recent discoveries of multiple remote vulnerabilities in Apache
Server (www.apache.org) by security companies (chiefly NAI.com/horizon),
GOBBLES members have been investigating other http servers to see if they
can outperform the security of Apache Server (yes, we have developed our
own remote exploits for Apache Server and are keeping them quiet for the
time -- go ahead and call us filthy blackhats, we have our own personal
reasons for not disclosing them at this time).  We think Apache Server is
a _great_ product; we're just interested in seeing how others line up
against it.

One of the servers we came across is Cherokee Webserver.  From the
author's website, I submit the following paste:

As you can see, this server brags exceptional speed.  The real question
is, however, is it secure?

Our tests suggest it isn't. >:-)


PROBLEMS
********

The first problem is a simple directory traversal bug.  No exploit code is
needed to demonstrate this; netcat and Internet Explorer seem to be
sufficient.  By adding several instances of /../ to the end of a request,
one is able to traverse the entire filesystem.

Notice, this server brags to run in a "chroot" environment, but by this
test we see something is definately wrong.

The second problem is that it does not drop privilages.  Since it needs to
start as root to bind to tcp 80, and does not drop privilages, there is an
obvious problem.  Without even doing a source code audit, we immediately
realize the potential and instantaneous remote root comprimise here when
used with the first problem described above; a clever penetrator who is
familiar with various password storage mechanisms on Unix-basd platforms
will know enough to go after files like /etc/passwd|shadow|master.passwd,
then from there it's just a matter of ./john -i to become root.


WORKAROUNDS
***********

GOBBLES Labs highly recommends using a better http server, one that can at
least attempt to brag security.  Speed isn't as important as security, so
don't trust any product that only brags speed.

*note from GOBBLES:
  hey hey hey it GOBBLES hehehe all GOBBLES want to say is that he did not
  instruct researchers at GOBBLES Labs to investigate further into this
  and there probably many holes in sourcecode like bufferoverflow and
  format bug strings for easier exploitation but GOBBLES think after 
  showing two root hole in product it time to move on and go to next and
  that GOBBLES promise to revisit it after author patch these problems,
  hehe, at least make it chroot! *
