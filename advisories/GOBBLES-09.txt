BACKGROUD
*********

OK as usual GOBBLES have a quick paste from vendor website describing the
product for you in the case of that you do not already know what is the
OpenSSH.

                                 [OpenSSH]

                 OpenSSH 3.0.1 released November 15, 2001.
               Contains support for SSH1 and SSH2 protocols.

   OpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH protocol suite of network
   connectivity tools that increasing numbers of people on the Internet
   are coming to rely on. Many users of telnet, rlogin, ftp, and other
   such programs might not realize that their password is transmitted
   across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all
   traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping,
   connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks. Additionally,
   OpenSSH provides a myriad of secure tunneling capabilities, as well as
   a variety of authentication methods.

   The OpenSSH suite includes the ssh program which replaces rlogin and
   telnet, scp which replaces rcp, and sftp which replaces ftp. Also
   included is sshd which is the server side of the package, and the
   other basic utilities like ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-keygen and
   sftp-server. OpenSSH supports SSH protocol versions 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0.

So if you do not understand it now GOBBLES will explain that OpenSSH is a
free and not commercial version of SSH (hence it is called OpenSSH not ssh
dot commercial) which allows encryption of network protocols and similar
things so that no more data can be transmitted plaintext to fall victim to
evil sniffing programs to collect passwords and other information which
can be used in sophisticated attacks against networks and computers and
users connected to the networks.

Anyhow here is how GOBBLES came to start researching the security of the
OpenSSH.  Lately on securityfocus.com GOBBLES have been reading a lot
about the old OpenSSH crc32 backdoor and the security of SSH in general
has been questioned.  GOBBLES thinks that people should realize that the
SECURE from SECURE SHELL means that the communications are secure and are
not easily monitored and does not mean that the program itself is secure
and bugfree.  Then GOBBLES was on his favorite security website one day
which is http://www.packetstormsecurity.org and GOBBLES did see:

   .: file detail
   File Name File Size Last Modified
   openssh-3.0.1p1.tar.gz 780980 Nov 19 11:31:11 2001
   This is a Linux/portable port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH. OpenSSH
   is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with all
   patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs fixed,
   new features reintroduced, and many other clean-ups. Changes: Fixed a
   security hole that may allow an attacker to authenticate if -- and
   only if -- the administrator has enabled KerberosV. Full changelog
   available here.  Homepage: http://www.openssh.com/. By Damien Miller

Hehehe see where it say "all known security bugs fixed" is what made
GOBBLES want to see if GOBBLES could find any new security bugs and of
course GOBBLES did otherwise why would this advisory be written?


SECURITY HISTORY
****************

GOBBLES think the most prominant OpenSSH bug known in history is the
famous CORE SDI backdoor which is so significant of a bug that it is the
only bug in OpenSSH that has been known to this time that is worthy of
being mentioned here.  Here GOBBLES have some links to about it for you!

and many others but too many for GOBBLES to list here because by now you
get the ideas hehehe!


VERSIONS AFFECTED
*****************

For this exercise GOBBLES did use the latest OpenSSH version 3.0.1p1 and
also did GOBBLES check earlier 2.9 versions to find that yes indeed the
bug is there too, but GOBBLES did not go back and investigate any further
than the 2.9 and 3.0 versions of the OpenSSH.  

Not tested by GOBBLES is SSH dot COMMERCIAL version of OpenSSH which may
or may not be able to be attacked in a such a way as GOBBLES will soon
disclose to you!  


THE PROBLEM
***********

First GOBBLES think you need to understand what is sftp which is secure
ftp so now GOBBLES will take a look at some manpages for you so you can
read them.

from man sftp GOBBLES does present the following paste:

SFTP(1)                     System Reference Manual                    SFTP(1)

NAME
     sftp - Secure file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     sftp [-1Cv] [-b batchfile] [-F ssh_config] [-o ssh_option] [-s subsystem
          | sftp_server] [-S program] host
     sftp [[user@]host[:file [file]]]
     sftp [[user@]host[:dir[/]]]

DESCRIPTION
     sftp is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp(1),  which
     performs all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also
     use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compres-
     sion.  sftp connects and logs into the specified host, then enters an in-
     teractive command mode.

     The second usage format will retrieve files automatically if a non-inter-
     active authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after suc-
     cessful interactive authentication.

     The last usage format allows the sftp client to start in a remote direc-
     tory.

So now it is you understand what sftp is for but GOBBLES explain it again in
in more clear terms so that some other penetrators might get to understand
it better basically sftp is programs to be used with sshd to send files
over encryption so that people can't use evil programs like filesnarf to
intercept your ftp transfers and also they can not sniff and steal your
passwords to the systems either since they are all done over ssh
communications when using sftp.  GOBBLES think sftp is nicer for that than
ftp because of no plaintext and even ftp that uses ssl is still vulnerable
to clever modifications of ettercap from http://ettercap.sourceforge.net.

But GOBBLES did find a major security hole in the sftp which is now fully
disclosed.  First GOBBLES demonstrate the hole to you.

root@localhost:~# telnet localhost 22

As you can see that when GOBBLES uses sftp that it do not log to utmp like
ftp would so it would look like no one is on the system, so if an evil
penetrator does sniff a pop3 password that he can now have full access to
all files on the system without raising any alarms because clever admin
who run 'watch w' on their tty to see who is sneaking around they system
will not know an intruder is there like they would with the ftp.  Also
GOBBLES know from neohapsis.com thread called "SFTP + Chroot" that the
sftp is not chrooted like real ftp server so that now the attacker have
access to all files in / with permissions set for the uid of the sniffed
pop3 password account, more on this can be found from thread:

http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/sf/linux/2001-q4/0260.html

For the credit of the OpenSSH sftp programmers GOBBLES does note that sftp
do write to syslog see here from grep and paste:

messages:Nov 26 21:04:18 localhost sshd[16833]: subsystem request for sftp
messages:Nov 26 22:40:08 localhost sshd[25665]: Failed password for
sftpsucks from 127.0.0.1 port 1588 ssh2
messages:Nov 26 22:40:37 localhost sshd[25669]: Accepted password for
sftpsucks
from 127.0.0.1 port 1589 ssh2
messages:Nov 26 22:40:37 localhost sshd[25669]: subsystem request for sftp

But GOBBLES know that a clever attacker can just grep -v this after he
gain root.  Oh, GOBBLES did not explain how to get root from this exploit
yet, hehehe well here is how.  See in example how GOBBLES is able to get
/etc/passwd downloaded from sniffed pop3?  Well if idiot administrator
does not use modern shadow techniques on he system GOBBLES could now use
password cracker to gain root password and then control of the
system.  More clever attacks that GOBBLES can think of include sending a
copy of netcat and cgi script and upload it then run it to get shell
access without anyone seeing then doing evil work like ptrace to get root
on a system without anyone even seeing then grep -v the pesky
/var/log/messages and no one would ever know the intruder was there.  Hehe
GOBBLES suggest that the name SECURE SHELL to be changed to SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS SHELL so it is not misleading about the security status of
the bugfilled program.

VENDOR NOTIFICATION STATUS
**************************

Lead OpenBSD developer Theo de Ratt have been notified via email by
GOBBLES about this hole and suspect that it soon be fixed to log in a
secure fashion.


SUGGESTED WORKAROUNDS
*********************

Until patch for OpenSSH is issued GOBBLES suggest that everyone just
killall -9 sshd and wait for security update patch to be added for logging
sftp in the proper fashion.

GOBBLES still have not received any clarification from the Legions of the
Underworld Leader Digital Ebola about issuing statements to the
underground on public websites.  GOBBLES wonder what happen next, a
message board for the underground to talk about their motives publically
for the media to read and write about?  Hehehe GOBBLES does not think this
is a very underground practice because why should the underground really
want the rest of the world to know what they are thinking?
